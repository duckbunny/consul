The consul package implements the Pool and Declare interfaces for the Herald package. https://github.com/duckbunny/herald

The package takes one flag "consul-ttl" to set the time until the service expires from consul using a heartbeat.


The package utilizies the Default client returned from consul api, but this can be overriden by editing.

	ConsulConfig.Config.Address = "192.168.1.56"

This service must be registered with herald.

	consul.Register()

Or you can fall back on the herald service registry, to register all available services.
